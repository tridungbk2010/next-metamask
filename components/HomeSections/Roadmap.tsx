        Who cares about roadmaps when there is a DAO? Each Cryptorontonian can
        help shape the future of the project by submitting proposals to the DAO.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, our playbook is simple; make the Cryptorontonians IP
        grow as much as possible through disruptive IRL showcases, exclusive
        collabs with other projects and community rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are proud to announce that our first IRL showcase is at Stackt Market
        Art Gallery. But this is just the beginning. We are working hard to make
        this the first of many exhibits worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a long term game. Itâ€™s all about growing the IP and bringing
        value to the Cryptorontonians holders.
