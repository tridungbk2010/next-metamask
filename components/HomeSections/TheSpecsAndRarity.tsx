        Each Cryptorontonian is unique and equally rare. They are created
        randomly by a custom generative algorithm from over 175 possible traits
        including expression, headwear, clothing and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no explicit rules for attribute scarcity. All Cryptorontonians
        are equally cool - the real distinction is between being in the
        community or outside the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cryptorontonians are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
        and hosted on IPFS. Purchasing a Cryptorontonian costs 0.08 ETH.
