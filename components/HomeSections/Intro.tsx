        What is Cryptorontonians?
      </span>{' '}
      Cryptorontonians is our first project. It’s a DAO driven collection of
      6,555 unique digital characters living on the Ethereum blockchain. Each
      Cryptorontonian is unique and is a tribute to our home – Toronto – and its
      fiercest dwellers – the raccoons.

        What’s so special about it?
      </span>{' '}
      Hold a Cryptorontonian and automatically become a member of the DAO. The
      DAO treasury gets 25% of all the profits Non Fungible Thrills generates
      with Cryptorontonians and all future projects. Yeah..FOREVER.
